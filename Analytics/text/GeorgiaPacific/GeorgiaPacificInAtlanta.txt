The fourth Wells account moving to another agency is the packaged paperproducts division of Georgia Pacific Corp., which arrived at Wells only last fall. Like Hertz, and the History Channel, it is also leaving for an Omnicom owned agency, the BBDO south unit of BBDO Worldwide. BBDO South, in Atlanta, which handles advertising for Georgia Pacific, will assume additional duties for brands like Angel Soft toilet tissue and Sparkle paper towels, said Ken Haldin, a spokesman for Georgia Pacific in Atlanta.
